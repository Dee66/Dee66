# Dee Prinsloo  
**Senior Software Engineer | GenAI (AWS) | AI Platform & Infrastructure Engineering**

I specialize in building secure, deterministic, and cost-efficient AI infrastructure on AWS.  
My focus is on reproducible pipelines, GPU FinOps, Terraform governance, and secure RAG architectures. Tools that make AI systems safer, cheaper, and easier to operate in real production environments.

---

## ⚙️ GuardSuite: AI Infrastructure Governance Tools  
Design philosophy: **deterministic outputs, security-by-default, offline execution, zero-IAM assumptions.**

I build open-source scanners that surface high-impact risks in AI and GPU workloads -before they reach production.

---

### **VectorScan (Open-Source Security Scanner)**  
High-signal analysis for vector databases and RAG pipelines.  
Detects unsafe retrieval patterns, embedding leakage, and configuration drift.  
👉 https://github.com/Dee66/VectorScan

### **ComputeScan (Open-Source GPU Governance Scanner)**  
GPU cost-governance and utilization analysis.  
Identifies cost drift, underutilization, scaling anomalies, and waste patterns.  
👉 https://github.com/Dee66/ComputeScan

---

## 🧩 Governance Blueprints (Optional, Enterprise-Facing Extensions)

These modules provide **enforceable policies** and **exportable audit results** for teams that need stronger governance signals.  
All scanners remain fully open source.

### **VectorGuard Blueprint**  
Zero-Trust RAG governance with reproducible OPA policies and audit-ready compliance outputs.

### **ComputeGuard Blueprint**  
GPU FinOps governance with utilization insights, drift analysis, and reproducible cost reports.

---

## 📘 Terraform Demo Repository  
A set of real Terraform plans demonstrating vector security flaws, GPU drift, and misconfiguration scenarios validated by GuardSuite scanners.
