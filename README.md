# Hi, I'm Dee 👋  
AI Infrastructure Architect focused on Terraform plan correctness, GPU FinOps, and secure RAG pipelines.

I build deterministic, offline-first governance tools that help teams ship AI infra with confidence — no telemetry, no guesswork, and no black boxes.

# 🚀 GuardSuite  
**Security + FinOps governance for Terraform plans.**  
Purpose-built for modern AI, GPU-heavy, and RAG workloads.

## 🔹 Free Scanners  
**VectorScan** — High-signal scanner for RAG/vector database security  
👉 https://github.com/GuardSuite/VectorScan  

**ComputeScan** — Detects GPU cost drift, autoscaling issues, and utilization waste  
👉 https://github.com/GuardSuite/ComputeScan

# 💼 Paid Governance Blueprints  
Commercial-grade governance for teams that need executive-level proof.

### **VectorGuard Blueprint — $79/year**  
**Auditable Compliance Ledger for Zero-Trust RAG security.**  
Get CISO-grade proof, not just alerts. Deterministic OPA policies, full drift analysis, and an exportable governance artifact.

### **ComputeGuard Blueprint — $129/year**  
**CFO-ready Zero-Waste Score for GPU cost certainty.**  
Complete drift autopsy, underutilization detection, GPU-rightsizing intelligence, and FinOps-grade governance reporting.
